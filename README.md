# Speech-driven Hand Gesture Generation Demo
This repository can be used to reproduce our results of applying our model to a new English dataset.

If you want to learn more about the model - this [video](https://youtu.be/Iv7UBe92zrw) is a good start.

Example of generate motion can be seen in the [demo video](https://youtu.be/tQLVyTVtsSU).

## Requirements
* python 3
* ffmpeg (to visualize the results)

## Install dependencies
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
./generate.sh  data/audio*.wav
```
Where in place of `audio*.wav` you can use any file from the folder `data`, which are chunks of the test sequences.
 Alternatively, you can download more audios for testing from [the Trinity Speech-Gesture dataset](https://trinityspeechgesture.scss.tcd.ie/Audio/).
(The recordings 'NaturalTalking_01.wav' and 'NaturalTalking_02.wav' were not used in training and were left them for testing)

## Training on your own data
For training on your own data we refer you to the [original repository](https://github.com/GestureGeneration/Speech_driven_gesture_generation_with_autoencoder) with the official implementation of the paper.

## Contact
If you encounter any problems/bugs/issues please contact me on Github or by emailing me at tarask@kth.se for any bug reports/questions/suggestions. I prefer questions and bug reports on Github as that provides visibility to others who might be encountering same issues or who have the same questions.
